 * Given a graph G = (V, E), a visibility representation Γ, for G maps 
every  vertex  v  in V    to  a  horizontal  vertex  segment  Γ(v)  and  every  edge  (u, v)  ∈ E  to  a 
vertical  edge segment Γ(u, v) such that each vertical edge segment Γ(u, v) has its endpoints 
lying on the horizontal vertex segments Γ(u) and Γ(v) and no other segment intersections 
or overlaps occur.
